# ReceiveMesh

MeshNet LED System for ESP32.

Not tested on ESP8266

But you can #include <ESP8266WiFi.h> instead of <WiFi.h>

Voltage for WS2812B recommended @ 5V

The ESP8266's 3.3V output does work, but unreliably.

Implemented using [Painless Mesh](https://github.com/gmag11/painlessMesh) & [FastLED](https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED)
